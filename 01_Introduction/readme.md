Decided to try a 30 JavaScript challenge.  I don't feel I need to relearn everything but I defiently need to revisit some fundamentals with fresh eyes so I can fully understand this beautiful language.

I'm not totally sure where/how I found this 30 day challenge but I the individual (Asabeneh https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/readMe.md#introduction) has a github page that I will be following.

I plan on following as needed but I also plan on making sure to read each day and digest the parts that need help on.  

Day 0 - I decided to bypass all of the inital setup and start with adding JS to a Web Page

    JS can be added to a web page in 3 different ways:
    - Inline script
    - Internal script
    - External script
    - Multiple External scripts

Inline Script
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfScript:Inline Script</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button onclick="alert('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript!')">Click Me</button>
  </body>
</html>
